geneAggregationMatrix
=====================
1. Run "agg_genes.py" to obtain the aggregated matrix which I have included in this folder as well.

2. Read the comments between the triple quotation marks (""") for detailed description of each function/section of code.

3. "agg_genes.py" use the files "list.txt", "compoundList.txt", and "self_score.csv".
